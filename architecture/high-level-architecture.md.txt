# High-Level Architecture – AWS Photo Sharing App

## Overview

This architecture demonstrates a production-ready, Instagram-like Photo Sharing App built entirely on **AWS services**. The design follows a **3-tier architecture** with secure networking, scalable compute, managed storage, serverless processing, and monitoring.

The application integrates the following key AWS services:

* **Networking:** VPC, public/private subnets, Internet Gateway, route tables
* **Security & Identity:** IAM Users, Groups, Roles; KMS encryption; Secrets Manager
* **Compute:** EC2 instances (Docker), Lambda serverless functions, Application Load Balancer
* **Storage:** S3 buckets for media storage, RDS for relational data
* **Monitoring:** CloudWatch dashboards, metrics, and alarms

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Networking Layer

* **VPC:** Provides an isolated network for the application
* **Subnets:**

  * **Public Subnet:** Hosts EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer
  * **Private Subnet:** Hosts RDS database and Lambda functions, not directly exposed to the internet
* **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Enables internet access for public-facing resources
* **Route Tables:** Direct traffic between subnets and IGW

### 2. Security Layer

* **IAM Users, Groups, and Roles:** Manage access and permissions for developers, admins, and services
* **KMS (Key Management Service):** Encrypts sensitive data at rest
* **Secrets Manager:** Securely stores database credentials and API keys

### 3. Compute Layer

* **EC2 Instances:** Run Docker containers for the frontend and backend services
* **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Distributes incoming traffic across EC2 instances
* **Lambda Functions:** Serverless image processing (resizing, thumbnail creation, metadata extraction)

### 4. Storage Layer

* **S3 Buckets:** Store user-uploaded photos and processed images
* **RDS Database:** Relational database for user data, posts, and metadata

### 5. Monitoring Layer

* **CloudWatch:** Monitors infrastructure metrics, logs, and sets alarms for thresholds (CPU, memory, Lambda errors, etc.)

## Data Flow

1. Users upload photos via the frontend served from EC2 instances.
2. ALB routes requests to EC2 instances running backend services.
3. Uploaded images are stored in **S3** and optionally processed by **Lambda**.
4. **RDS** stores metadata (user info, post details, comments).
5. **CloudWatch** tracks application and infrastructure health.
6. IAM ensures secure access for users and services, enforcing least-privilege principles.

## Key Features

* **3-Tier Architecture:** Frontend, backend, and database layers separated for security and scalability
* **Serverless Processing:** Lambda functions handle image processing without managing servers
* **End-to-End Security:** IAM, KMS, and Secrets Manager protect sensitive data
* **Scalable & Resilient:** ALB distributes traffic; RDS can run in Multi-AZ configuration
* **Monitoring & Alerts:** CloudWatch dashboards provide real-time insights
