# VPC & Networking Fundamentals

**Lab 1 – AWS Cloud Photo Sharing Application**

---

## Overview

This lab establishes the **network foundation** for the application by creating a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), defining subnet-level segmentation, and configuring controlled internet access.

The objective is to design a network layout that separates **internet-facing components** from **internal services**, following AWS-recommended architecture patterns.

---

## Environment

* AWS Console (lab-provided temporary account)
* Region: `us-east-1 (N. Virginia)`

---

## Network Design Summary

| Component        | Configuration               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| VPC              | `kloudtask-vpc`             |
| VPC CIDR         | `10.16.0.0/16`              |
| Public Subnet    | `10.16.1.0/24` (us-east-1a) |
| Private Subnet   | `10.16.2.0/24` (us-east-1a) |
| Internet Gateway | `kloudtask-igw`             |
| Route Table      | `public-rt`                 |

## VPC Configuration

A custom VPC was created with CIDR block `10.16.0.0/16` to define an isolated network boundary for all application resources.

### Key Points

* Custom VPC used instead of default VPC for better control
* CIDR range allows sufficient IP capacity for multiple subnets and future scaling
* DNS resolution and hostnames enabled to support AWS-managed services

---

## Subnet Segmentation

Two subnets were created within the VPC to separate responsibilities:

### Public Subnet

* CIDR: `10.16.1.0/24`
* Availability Zone: `us-east-1a`
* Intended for internet-facing components such as:

  * Application Load Balancer (ALB)

### Private Subnet

* CIDR: `10.16.2.0/24`
* Availability Zone: `us-east-1a`
* Intended for internal components such as:

  * Databases
  * Backend services

Subnet sizes were chosen to balance IP availability and manageability.

## Internet Connectivity

### Internet Gateway

An Internet Gateway (`kloudtask-igw`) was created and attached to the VPC to enable outbound and inbound internet communication where explicitly allowed.

### Route Table Configuration

A dedicated route table (`public-rt`) was created with the following route:

* `0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway`

This route table was associated **only** with the public subnet.

### Isolation Enforcement

* Public subnet has a default route to the Internet Gateway
* Private subnet has no route to the Internet Gateway
* Private resources remain isolated from direct internet access

---

## Verification

The following checks were completed:

* VPC exists with correct CIDR and status `Available`
* Internet Gateway is attached to the VPC
* Public subnet routes traffic to the Internet Gateway
* Private subnet has no internet route configured

---

## Key Observations

* Subnets are classified as public or private based on routing, not naming
* Internet access is disabled by default at the VPC level
* Route table associations are critical for enforcing isolation
* This design aligns with common production AWS architectures

## Conclusion

This lab established a secure and scalable network foundation that supports:

* Public access for web-facing components
* Private isolation for sensitive backend services
