# RDS Security & Managed Database Fundamentals

**Lab 4 – AWS Cloud Photo Sharing Application**



## Overview

This lab establishes a **managed relational database layer** for the application using Amazon RDS. The focus is on deploying a secure MySQL database, enforcing network isolation, enabling encryption, and validating backup and scaling capabilities.

The objective is to design a database setup that follows **production-grade security and availability best practices** while offloading operational overhead to AWS.

## Environment

* AWS Console (lab-provided temporary account)
* Region: `us-east-1 (N. Virginia)`
* Database Engine: MySQL

## Database Configuration Summary

| Component       | Configuration                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| DB Identifier   | `kodekloud-lab-db`                     |
| Engine          | MySQL community version                                 |
| Deployment Type | Single-AZ                              |
| Instance Class  | Modified during lab (Vertical Scaling) |
| Storage         | AWS-managed EBS                        |
| Encryption      | Enabled                                |
| Public Access   | Disabled                               |
| Backup Method   | Manual DB Snapshot                     |

## RDS Instance Configuration

A MySQL RDS instance was provisioned using AWS-managed infrastructure to act as the primary relational database for the application.

### Key Points

* No operating system or database server management required
* AWS handles patching, maintenance, and hardware provisioning
* Instance created using console-based configuration for controlled setup

---

## Network & Access Control

The database was deployed in **private networking context** to ensure isolation from the public internet.

### Public Accessibility

* **Public Access: Disabled**
* Database is not reachable from the open internet
* Access is restricted to resources within the VPC

### Security Implications

* Reduces attack surface
* Aligns with best practices for backend data stores
* Prevents direct exposure of database endpoints

---

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest

Encryption was enabled to protect stored data using AWS-managed encryption mechanisms.

* Protects data on disk
* Ensures compliance with common security standards
* Transparent to the application layer

---

## Scaling Strategy

### Vertical Scaling

The DB instance class was modified during runtime to demonstrate vertical scaling.

* No data loss during modification
* Minimal downtime depending on configuration
* Allows adaptation to increased workload demands

---

## Backup & Recovery

### Manual Snapshot

A manual DB snapshot was created to capture a point-in-time backup of the database.

* Snapshot persists independently of the DB lifecycle
* Can be used to restore or clone databases
* Critical for disaster recovery scenarios

---

## Verification

The following checks were completed:

* RDS instance status shows `Available`
* Public access is set to `No`
* Encryption is enabled
* DB snapshot is visible and in `Available` state
* Instance class modification completed successfully

---

## Key Observations

* RDS abstracts infrastructure management while retaining control
* Network isolation is enforced at the service level
* Backups and scaling can be performed without manual server access
* Databases should always reside in private network boundaries

* Manual snapshot creation



## Conclusion

This lab established a secure, scalable, and production-aligned relational database layer that supports:

* Secure storage of application data
* Controlled access within private networks
* Operational resilience through backups and scaling

By using Amazon RDS, the application benefits from managed reliability while maintaining strong security guarantees.
