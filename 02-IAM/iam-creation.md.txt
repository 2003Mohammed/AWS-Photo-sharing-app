# IAM Lab — AWS Photo Sharing App

## Overview

This lab implements **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** to secure the cloud environment. IAM provides centralized control over **who can access AWS resources** and **what actions they can perform**, enabling secure and scalable access management.

The lab demonstrates the creation of IAM Users, Groups, Roles, and the application of **permissions policies**.

---

## Environment

* AWS Console (lab-provided account)
* Region: `us-east-1` (N. Virginia)
* Existing IAM admin user with permission to create users, groups, and roles

---

## Lab Objectives

* Create an IAM User with console access
* Create an IAM Group and assign users
* Create an IAM Role for temporary access
* Apply least-privilege permissions

---

## Task 1: Create an IAM User

**Goal:** Create a dedicated IAM user for console access with unique credentials.

**Steps Performed:**

1. Accessed **IAM → Users → Create user**
2. Configured user details:

   * **User name:** `iamuser-analyst`
   * Enabled **AWS Management Console access**
   * Set **Custom password:** `Password123!`
   * Unchecked **Require password reset at next sign-in**
3. Attached permissions by copying from the current admin user
4. Verified `iamuser-analyst` exists in the IAM Users list

**Verification:**

* [x] IAM user `iamuser-analyst` exists
* [x] Console access enabled
* [x] Permissions applied successfully

---

## Task 2: Create an IAM Group

**Goal:** Create a group to manage multiple users efficiently.

**Steps Performed:**

1. Accessed **IAM → User groups → Create group**
2. Configured:

   * **Group name:** `finance-team`
3. Added all existing users to the group
4. Attached **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy
5. Verified users and policy assignment

**Verification:**

* [x] IAM group `finance-team` exists
* [x] Policy attached correctly
* [x] All intended users are members

---

## Task 3: Create an IAM Role

**Goal:** Create a role to provide temporary, secure access.

**Steps Performed:**

1. Accessed **IAM → Roles → Create role**
2. Configured trusted entity:

   * **Trusted entity type:** AWS account
   * **Select AWS account:** This account
3. Attached **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy
4. Named the role `finance-manager` and optionally added a description
5. Verified role creation and **Trust relationships**

**Verification:**

* [x] IAM role `finance-manager` exists
* [x] Policy attached correctly
* [x] Trust relationship points to current AWS account

## Knowledge Check: Roles vs Users

**Question:** Why is attaching an IAM Role to an EC2 instance better than using IAM User access keys?

**Answer:**

* Roles provide **temporary credentials** that rotate automatically
* Reduces risk of **credential leakage**
* Automatically available to EC2 via **instance metadata service**
* Supports **least-privilege access** without long-term keys

---

## Lab Summary

* **Granular Identity:** Created `iamuser-analyst` with specific permissions
* **Scalable Management:** Managed multiple users via `finance-team` group
* **Temporary Security:** Created `finance-manager` role for secure temporary access
* **Access Control:** Applied policies to enforce least privilege

**Importance:**

* Establishes a **secure foundation** for enterprise applications
* Follows AWS best practices for user access and service security
* Supports auditing and compliance
